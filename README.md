# MetalTurtle18 Personal Website

This is my personal website. I will add more to the readme as interesting things come up. I am using Astro.js because it
easy to use and seems to be faster than the bloat of React and friends.

### Claude Code

I am also using this as a chance to learn how to interact with agentic AI, specifically Claude Code. I am not happy about this, but I know I need to have experience doing it.
