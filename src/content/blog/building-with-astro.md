# Building Modern Websites with Astro

Astro has become my go-to framework for building content-focused websites. Its unique approach to shipping zero JavaScript by default makes it incredibly fast.

## Why Astro?

There are several reasons why I've been gravitating toward Astro for my projects:

1. **Performance First**: Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, only adding it when necessary.
2. **Content Collections**: Built-in support for managing content with type safety.
3. **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework you prefer.
4. **Great DX**: Excellent developer experience with fast build times and hot module reloading.

## Content Collections

One of my favorite features is Content Collections. They provide:

- Type-safe frontmatter
- Automatic TypeScript definitions
- Easy content querying
- Built-in schema validation with Zod

## Conclusion

If you're building a content-heavy site like a blog or documentation, I highly recommend giving Astro a try. The performance benefits alone make it worth exploring.
